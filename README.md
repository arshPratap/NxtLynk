## Problem Statement

We aim to provide a smart agricultural platform for farmers and connect them to people and organizations from several sectors that our heavily involved in our agricultural system.

**Preferred tech stack:** *A website that consumes Python REST APIs.*

Using our application we ensure the following benefits to the community :-

* Vendor pricing are lower since there is no need for a middleman.

* Provide an effective food supply chain that allows farmers and other users to openly exchange data and therefore build confidence among the organizations/people involved. 

* Provide a faster and more efficient mechanism for insurance firms to validate claims.

* Allowing farmers and vendors to interact with one another in a more efficient and secure manner, resulting in a closer-knit community.

* We use machine learning to provide farmers, insurance providers, and suppliers with forecasts about the ultimate yield, making future transactions easier.

* Connect farmers with their respective consumers via a blockchain-based E-commerce platform (which is built in part on the aforementioned agricultural supply chain).

## Objective

The business idea behind this project is to build an E-platform which will provide -

- a smart agriculture system to the farmers which will increase their crop production and reach as well.

- the insurance company a transparent data system which will help them to prevent any insurance fraud.

- consumers a direct connection with farmers so they can get quality products in a reasonable price
